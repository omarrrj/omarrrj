- 👋 Hi, I’m @omarrrj
- 👀 I’m and I am a motivated full-stack software developer interested in web development. I have always been motivated and interested in problem-solving, even from a young age. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying software engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University.They have provided an excellent opportunity for me to apply my problem-solving skills.
- 💞️ I would like to collab with people where my advancement and learning paths are well-defined so that I can pursue them intently, and I think that is only going to be possible if I work at a company with a larger development team, or with more seniors to observe.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email: omarjeylaani@hotmail.com
